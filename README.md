# AttendanceBackEnd Start Guide

To start collaborating be sure to have _pip_ installed and _python 3.11.0_.
Check running these commands:
```
python --version
pip --version
```

**NOTE**: Usually if you are using _PyCharm IDE_ it installs _pip_ as well.

If you don't have them installed run the following commands to install _python3_ and _pip_.:<br>

- **Windows**: `py -m ensurepip --default-pip`
- **Linux**:   `python3 -m ensurepip --default-pip`

Then proceed to install _mfrc522_, the required library to work with RFID reader.<br>
Install using this command on terminal:
`pip install mfrc522-python`

Now you are ready to go.

For more guidance refer to these guides:
